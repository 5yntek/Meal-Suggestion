Raw image data for training is far to big for github. You can recreate our data from coco dataset using pycoco_ingredients.txt. Our simulation data is located at ../simulationData_v2/. Move it or symlink it.

./yolov5 is a modifed version of https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5. Our .yaml files are located at ./yolov5/data. ./yolov5/runs/ contains information and logging of our runs and tests.
